      <h1>Difference between Not Defined and Undefined</h1>
      <p>The JavaScript code is being executed in two-phase,
      <ol>
        <li>
          The first one is the memory allocation phase during this all the variables and function definitions get stored inside the memory heap. The JavaScript assigns undefined to each variable in this phase.
        </li>
        <li>
          The second one is a thread of the execution phase, during this the code written inside the JavaScript file is being
          executed.
          Each variable holds the value undefined till the program reaches the line where we have assigned that variable.
          After that line, the variableâ€™s undefined value gets replaced by the original value.</p>
        </li>

      </ol>
      <table>

          <th>Not Defined</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>It works like when we declared a variable in the code but did not assign the value before printing the variable value</td>
          <td>It works like when we did not declare the variable and try to call that variable.</td>
